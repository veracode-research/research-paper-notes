### Issues to be Resolved

Organizing my subjects, etc, could be tricky here so let's try to maintain
some flexiblity and create subdirectories.  Currently, I'm thinking
high level subjects, for example -
* Securtiy
* Misc.
* Machine Learning
* Languages

We'll fgo with that and see how it works perhaps but certainly some
feedback would be helpful...
