## Research Papers

This repository is a set of collected research notes on various papers
that have been read - both good and bad, to allow for collaborative thinking
and discussion.

### Issues to be Resolved

Organizing by subject could be tricky here so let's try to maintain
some flexiblity and create subdirectories.  Currently, I'm thinking
high level subjects, for example -

* Security
* Misc.
* Machine Learning
* Languages

We'll go with that and see how it works perhaps but certainly some
feedback would be helpful...

### Style Guidelines

One thought was to leverage something like
[Mathematical Reviews/MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/publications/math-reviews/math-reviews)
as a style guide, so that this doesn't become  a "thumbs up" or
"thumbs down", but rather a distillation of the paper contents. A
useful reference for understanding the MR approach may be found in
their [Guide for Reviewers](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mresubs/guide-reviewers.html).
It may be useful for us to follow a similar path.
